 * All codes executed on call stack and inside call stack every fn executed in a execution context but the global fn executed in the global execution context.
 * Execution Context has two phases --
 * 1 - Memory Allocation - hositing
    *  variable - Undefind
    * Functions - Memory allocation in heap
 * 2 - Code Execution
