<!-- Using the overflow property helps control content display within an element, ensuring a better user experience and maintaining the layout's integrity. -->

<!-- The overflow property can be used to control the display of content that overflows the boundaries of an
element. This can be useful for ensuring a better user experience and maintaining the layout's integrity. -->

<!-- The .content-box element will have a total width of 260px (200px width + 20px padding * 2 + 10px border * 2). -->

<!-- The .border-box element will have a total width of 200px, as the padding and border are included within the specified width. -->

<!-- Explanation:
1 - Block Element: The .block element takes up the full width of its container and starts on a new line, pushing any subsequent content to the next line.

2 - Inline Element: The .inline elements are displayed inline, taking only as much width as necessary, and flowing within the same line as other inline elements.

3 - Inline-Block Element: The .inline-block elements are displayed inline with the ability to set width and height. They flow within the same line but can have block-like properties.

4 - None: The .none element is hidden entirely, taking up no space on the page. -->
